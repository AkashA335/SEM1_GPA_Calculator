          <p>“Giga Chad” or “Gigachad” refers to a character that is the ultimate Chad. He is usually represented by the male models featured in art project Sleek’N’Tears (YouTube, Instagram), which is the brainchild of Russian photographer Krista Sudmalis. The artwork features a lot of burly and scantily clad men and has an emphasis on muscle, fitness, and acrobatics. The most famous and widely used of these men is the model Ernest Khalimov who uses Instagram under the name berlin.1969. His image appears in a number of spin-off memes and has become synonymous with Chad.</p>
